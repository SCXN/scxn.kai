		I've put together a suite of easy-to-use web solutions focused on the lifestyles of real-world business leaders:

		<i>"Today's natural, elegant and modern approach to web publishing"</i>
	</h4>
	<p>
		In the past, the popular companies like WordPress, Wix and SquareSpace have taken pretty good care of businesses—especially up-and-coming, DIY ventures!
	</p>
	<p>
		And while these brands still offer very nice products, my designs offer a greater range of customization and connectedness, usually at a fraction of the cost.  Traditional content management systems like WordPress and popular e-commerce platforms like Wix have carved out loyal users, but their products leave their customers dangling out in the vastness of the web, aside from the connectedness and shareability of social media.
	</p>
	<p>
		And making time to update these types of websites often feels extraneous to the daily routine of busy, successful people.  But that isn't to say you aren't already doing the things that create fresh content for your website, it's that those already comfortable movements, those natural behaviors, the sites you already visit and publish your thoughts to, just haven't been harnessed yet.

		There are more modern, socially connected methods of reaching people today that circulate your brand and drive many more people to your website with much much less effort.  I build these websites.  They're called web apps.  Just like the apps you download to your phone from the google play store or apple store, or applications you download to your pc, web apps work the same, but they live online and <sup>1.)</sup>your visitors use them just like regular webpages they would normally visit at a familiar .com, .org or .net-style web address—they just do more!
	</p>
	<h3 class="reflection">
		Make significant updates to your website from your mobile phone:
	</h3>
	<p>
		Imagine everything you already do contributing fresh content to your website with little more than a few tweaks and settings here and there.  Post articles, update menus, notify your subscribers: All on the fly from your favorite blogging platform like blogger, tumblr or even service as ubiquitous as google docs.  Generating new content dynamically to your website is a very valuable attraction.  It boosts your search engine ranking otherwise known as your search engine optimization or SEO.  Furthermore, when your guests know that your website is regularly updated with meaningful content, they're likely to return to find out what's new subscribe to you.  
	</p>
	<h3 class="reflection">
		Save on recurring costs:
	</h3>
	<p>
		Social media has become the world's town square, where people share ideas and present their ventures.  It's robustly built at a large scale, routing millions of conversation everyday.  Avoid unnecessary costs with open source technology that harnesses tried and true social media platforms as dependable, convenient and virtually cost-free content management systems.  With a perfect product, you would simply post something great to facebook or twitter and it would automatically show up looking sharp on your website.  Your visitors can clearly see when such information has been published and are able to quickly share the content to their favorite social media outlets.  I provide you with such a product.

	<p>
		Free of proprietary trappings, we truly are only limited by imagination.  The solutions of the past produced good-looking results, but too easily dent brands into forms which adhered more to the technology of the platform rather than to the culture of the brand.  <sup>2.)</sup>With more freedom, today we're finally able to depict the truth.
